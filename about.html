            Welcome to <i><Strong>Have You Eaten?</Strong></i>, a space dedicated to the warmth and nostalgia of South Canara’s coastal foods. Inspired by the Tulu phrase <i>"Vanas Aanda? (ವನಸ್ ಆಂಡಾ?)"</i>—a friendly way to start a conversation by asking if someone has eaten—this site bridges food and memories. Here, you’ll find a stop-motion introduction that captures the heart of this idea, audio clips of my family members sharing their stories and favorite dishes, and a link to a scanned version of our cherished recipe book.

     <P >This platform isn’t just about recipes; it’s about preserving and sharing the bonds created around food, one story at a time.</P>
